## A Provable Approach for Double-Sparse Coding, AAAI-2018

The arXiv paper is on https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03638

### Goal
Learn to recover the sparse dictionary from samples generated by a generative model

### Data and simulation setting
* Deterministic, sparse, orthonormal dictionary
* Sparse, random and overcomplete dictionary

### Required Matlab add-ons and/or packages:
+ gaimc for the bipartite_matchings algorithm
+ Other packages to run Trainlets code

### How to run
Set the running mode for algorithm you want to test and run `run_simulation.m`.
